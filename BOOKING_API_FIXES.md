# Bookings API Fixes - Summary

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Bookings API Route Issues
- **Problem**: Frontend was making requests to `/api/bookings` but the backend route wasn't properly handling role-based access
- **Solution**: Updated the backend controller to properly filter bookings based on user role

### 2. ESLint Warning
- **Problem**: Unused `response` variable in `PropertyDetail.js` at line 80
- **Solution**: Removed the unused variable declaration

## 🔧 Backend Changes

### Updated `backend/src/controllers/booking.controller.js`

#### Enhanced `getAllBookings` Function
- **Role-based filtering**: 
  - **Renters**: See only their own bookings
  - **Owners**: See bookings for properties they own
- **Proper population**: Returns populated property and user details
- **Error handling**: Better error messages and logging

#### Enhanced `updateStatus` Function
- **Ownership verification**: Only property owners can update booking status
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized status updates
- **Proper population**: Returns updated booking with all necessary data

#### Added Property Model Import
- Imported Property model to check property ownership

## 🎯 API Endpoints

### `GET /api/bookings`
- **Renters**: Returns their own bookings
- **Owners**: Returns bookings for their properties
- **Response**: Populated with property and user details

### `GET /api/bookings/me`
- **Purpose**: Get current user's bookings (for renters)
- **Response**: Populated with property details

### `PUT /api/bookings/:id/status`
- **Purpose**: Update booking status (accept/reject)
- **Security**: Only property owners can update
- **Response**: Updated booking with populated data

## 🎨 Frontend Changes

### Updated `frontend/src/components/properties/PropertyDetail.js`
- **Fixed ESLint warning**: Removed unused `response` variable
- **Cleaner code**: Simplified booking submission function

### Updated `frontend/src/components/pages/OwnerDashboard.js`
- **Simplified booking fetch**: Backend now handles filtering
- **Cleaner code**: Removed unnecessary property ID filtering logic

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### For Renters:
1. Click "Book This Property" → Opens booking modal
2. Fill out dates and message → Submit booking
3. Booking saved with "pending" status
4. View bookings in "My Bookings" section

### For Owners:
1. View all booking requests for their properties in dashboard
2. See renter details and messages
3. Accept or reject pending bookings
4. Status updates reflect immediately in renter's view

### Data Flow:
1. **Frontend** → `/api/bookings` (role-based filtering)
2. **Backend** → Filters based on user role and property ownership
3. **Response** → Populated with all necessary data
4. **Frontend** → Displays filtered and populated data
